# Uncommon VBScript Bugs and Errors

This repository demonstrates some less common but potentially troublesome bugs in VBScript.  These are beyond the typical syntax errors and often lead to unexpected behavior or runtime crashes.

The `bug.vbs` file contains examples of these error scenarios, and the `bugSolution.vbs` file offers corrected or improved versions.

The problems highlighted include:
* Late Binding and Type Mismatches
* Implicit Type Coercion Issues
* Array Indexing Problems
* Issues with `On Error Resume Next`
* Handling Unexpected Data

This repository is for educational purposes, to help VBScript developers understand and avoid these less obvious problems.
