Improved Error Handling and Type Checking:
Always use explicit type checking to avoid late-binding issues and ensure data is of the correct type before using it in operations. VBScript's `TypeName()` function can be helpful for this.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim s
s = "10"
if TypeName(s) = "String" then
  'Convert s to a number
  x = CInt(s) + 5
else
  'Handle the case where s isn't a number
  MsgBox "s is not a number"
end if
```

Avoid Implicit Type Coercion:
Be explicit about type conversions. Avoid relying on VBScript's implicit type conversion behavior, as it can lead to unexpected results or errors.  Use functions like `CInt`, `CDbl`, `CStr` etc., for explicit conversion.

Proper Array Handling:
Remember that VBScript arrays are zero-based. Always double-check your array indexing to prevent subscript out of range errors.

Structured Error Handling:
Avoid relying solely on `On Error Resume Next`. Instead, use structured error handling with `On Error GoTo`, providing specific error handling routines.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error GoTo ErrHandler
'Your Code Here...
Exit Sub
ErrHandler:
MsgBox "Error Number: " & Err.Number & ", Description: " & Err.Description
End Sub
```

Data Validation:
Always validate external data to ensure it conforms to the expected format and data type before using it in your VBScript code. Use regular expressions or other validation techniques to check data integrity.

By addressing these issues, VBScript developers can write more robust and reliable code.
