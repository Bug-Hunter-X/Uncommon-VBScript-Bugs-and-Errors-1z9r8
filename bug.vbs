Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript uses late binding, meaning variable types aren't checked until runtime. This can lead to unexpected errors if a variable's type doesn't match how it's used. For example, trying to perform arithmetic on a string variable that contains non-numeric characters will throw a type mismatch error.

Example:
```vbscript
dims = "10abc"
x = 5 + s
```
This will cause a type mismatch error at runtime because VBScript cannot implicitly convert the string "10abc" to a number.

Implicit type coercion: VBScript attempts type coercion implicitly, which can be confusing. This means VBScript will try to convert data types automatically, but this might not always be what you intend.

Example:
```vbscript
dims = "10"
x = 5 + s
```
VBScript implicitly converts the string "10" to a number and the code works, but this might not always be the case for different data types.

Another common error occurs when working with arrays. VBScript's array indexing starts at 0, but it's easy to forget and start indexing at 1, which would cause an error.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim arr(5)
arr(1) = 10
```
The code would throw a subscript out of range error since the first element's index is 0 in VBScript.

Error Handling:  VBScript's error handling, using On Error Resume Next, can mask bugs. While convenient for ignoring minor issues, it can hide serious underlying problems, making debugging extremely difficult.  Always use a structured error handling approach to understand why errors are occurring.

Unexpected Data: Problems arise when dealing with data from external sources that don't match expected formats or data types.  If the data doesn't match what the code expects, unexpected errors or crashes can occur. Always validate external data before processing it in VBScript.
